# Environment Setup Task

This guide explains the steps I followed to set up the environments for the Practice of Software Development course from the CDE master.

## 1. Forking the Repository

I forked the original repository in:

ðŸ”— [https://github.com/Angelicarjs/geo-software-dev/tree/main](https://github.com/Angelicarjs/geo-software-dev/tree/main)

## 2. Local Folder Creation

On my local machine, I created a folder to store the project: C:\Users\angelica.moreno\environments_task

## 4. Verifying Conda Installation
Using the Anaconda Prompt, I navigated to the cloned repository and entered the folder A2, I then checked if conda was installed and verified the version using the command conda --version:
