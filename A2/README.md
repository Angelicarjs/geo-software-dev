# A2: Instructions

Here are the two conda environment files to recreate:

- *software_dev_v1.yml*
- *software_dev_v2.yml*

They are descriptions of the exact same environment, however, one description is more specific yet operating system (OS) dependent, and the other is OS generic but much less specific (i.e. no versions). Depending on the OS you are working on, you may be able to recreate both.

## Task

Go through the process of creating and modifying an environment

1) **Acquire** You can fork this repo or just download both files individually.
2) **Recreate** both environments with conda (or try to od so)
3) **Modify** one of the environments
4) **Export** the modified environment file (either as OS specific, or OS independent, up to you...)
5) **Commit** the modified env file to your personal GitHub repository you already created for this course
